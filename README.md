# deel-lip-pytorch

Controlling the Lipschitz constant of a layer or a whole neural network has many applications ranging
from adversarial robustness to Wasserstein distance estimation.

This library provides implementation of **k-Lispchitz layers for `PyTorch`**.

It is based on deel-lip implementation for Keras

## The library contains:

Nothing for the moment
