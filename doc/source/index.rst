Welcome to deel-lip documentation!
==================================================

Controlling the Lipschitz constant of a layer or a whole neural network has many applications ranging
from adversarial robustness to Wasserstein distance estimation.

This library provides implementation of **k-Lispchitz layers for** ``keras``.

The library contains:
---------------------

 * k-Lipschitz variant of keras layers such as `Dense`, `Conv2D` and `Pooling`,
 * activation functions compatible with `keras`,
 * kernel initializers and kernel constraints for `keras`,
 * loss functions when working with Wasserstein distance estimations,
 * tools to monitor the singular values of kernels during training,
 * tools to convert k-Lipschitz network to regular network for faster evaluation.


Installation
------------

You can install ``deel-lip`` directly from pypi:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install deel-lip

In order to use ``deel-lip``, you also need a `valid tensorflow installation <https://www.tensorflow.org/install>`_.
``deel-lip`` supports tensorflow from 2.0 to 2.2.
