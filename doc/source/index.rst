Welcome to deel-torchlip documentation!
==================================================

Controlling the Lipschitz constant of a layer or a whole neural network has many applications ranging
from adversarial robustness to Wasserstein distance estimation.

This library provides implementation of **k-Lispchitz layers for** ``pytorch``.

The library contains:
---------------------

 * k-Lipschitz variant of pytorch layers such as `Linear`, `Conv2d` and `AvgPool2d`,
 * activation functions compatible with `pytorch`,
 * kernel initializers for `pytorch`,
 * loss functions when working with Wasserstein distance estimations.

Installation
------------

You can install ``deel-torchlip`` directly from pypi:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install torchlip

In order to use ``torchlip``, you also need a `valid pytorch installation <https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/#installing-on-linux>`_.
``torchlip`` supports torch 1.7.0 +
